/**
 * The single treatment for text links: header nav, footer, and inline prose.
 *
 * A hairline underline rather than colour alone, so links are identifiable
 * without relying on a colour difference that's easy to miss against this
 * palette's muted body text. Both the text and the underline brighten on
 * hover, which also covers links that already sit at full contrast.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* applied to the things that only look like links: the
 * brand wordmark, and the calls to action carrying `buttonVariants` (the
 * homepage demo button and both on the 404 page). Those are different
 * affordances and underlining them would flatten the distinction.
 *
 * Shared verbatim with rtk-query-devtools.
